# RCG Forest

## About
**RCG Forest** is a theme for WordPress blogs, originally inspired by [Green Grapes](http://themes.rock-kitty.net/green-grapes/) theme.

The theme uses a responsive design, using HTML5 and CSS3, and provides support for recent WordPress features, such as featured images, custom menus, custom background, or custom page templates.
The main features of this theme are:
- green and gray as main colors;
- flexible width;
- two columns (with widgets support);
- footer widgets support;
- prepared to be localized;
- custom header;
- custom background.

The theme was rewritten for version 2 to provide a responsive design, based on HTML5 and CSS3. The support for some WordPress features (such as featured images, or custom headers) was also improved.
